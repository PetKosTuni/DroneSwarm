# DroneSwarm
Drone Swarm persistent monitoring repository for the course ROBO.666-2024-2025-1 Robotics Project Work

The project was developed in the Networked Robotics Laboratory (NeBoLab) - IINES in Tampere University at Hervanta campus. The project development was divided into three parts, the controller, the RViz-visualization and the UI.
The RVIZ and the controller code is contained in the same file, and the UI has two files in its own folder. The UI code contains parts of previous environment implementations, our parts are marked by comments. To run the code, the files need to be integrated with the NeBoLab environment.
